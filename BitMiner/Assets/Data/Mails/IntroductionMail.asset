  message: 'Hey kid


    as promised, I''ll be supplying you with graphics cards
    as long as you keep paying of course. In fact, the first shipment should have
    already arrived at your storage.


    And again.. don''t worry about where these
    cards come from... let''s just say I have my connections and there are some people
    who owe me.


    Pleasure doing business with you
